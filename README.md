Frequentist uncertainties for DRE with parameterized ensembles, based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00113.

This repository is a work in progress; currently it only contains the code to reproduce the results in the paper, contained in the experiments directory. In the future, it will also contain a step-by-step tutorial of how to implement $w_i f_i$ ensembles.

The experiments directory contains two directories, gaussian and qg, corresponding to the two case studies in the paper. The .py scripts generate results, and the .ipynb notebooks generate the figures from the results. The scripts take a long time to run on one GPU ($\mathcal{O}$(1 day) for the Gaussian case study, $\mathcal{O}$(1 week) for the quark/gluon case study), so if you are running additional small experiments you will likely want to either reduce the number of basis functions $M$, the number of trainings, or the number of trials per training. If your goal is to reproduce the results from the paper, or if you want to run larger experiments, you will likely need to parallelize over trainings; this is not difficult since the trainings are independent of each other, but the easiest way to implement this is environment specific, so we provide the serial version for generality.
